# SchoolCode
A repository for code that I wrote for school assignments.

## CSC 230: Elementary Data Structures and Algorithms
*Java*
My first programming course at UNCG, and my first programming course since taking AP Computer Science ten years earlier. Data structures included bags, arrays, stacks, queues, sets, concepts such as encapsulation and recursion, and basic sorting algorithms.

## CSC 261: Computer Organization and Assembly Language
*80x86 Assembly Language*
Half the course covered Von Neumann Architecture and logic circuitry, the other half was writing assembly. The assembly was written and compiled in Visual Studio.

## CSC 330: Advanced Data Structures
*Java*
Data structures incdluded trees, dictionaries, hash maps.

## CSC 339: Concepts of Programming Langauges
*C, C++, Java, Python*
A high level discussion and comparison of a variety of programming languages. Would have to implement an assignment in several different languages.

## CSC 340: Software Engineering
*Java*
Discussion of various SDLC's such as Waterfall and Agile, and design principles including UML and use cases. The code represents a group project to develop an exercise and meal tracking app. The folder labled Final is the completed project, the folder labled PT is a better representation of the code I contributed. Unfortunately, when we were working on this project none of us had really been exposed to version controlling or tools like Github yet. That definitely led to complications in the final stages of the project when we tried to merge our seperate parts together.


## Other Coursework
These classes either required no programming, or the code has been lost.

### CSC 250: Foundations of Computer Science I
*Non-programming course*
Set operations, boolean logic, inductive proofs, discrete mathematics.

### CSC 350: Foundations of Computer Scince II
*Non-programming course*
Predicate calculus, further proofs and logic

### CSC 471: Principles of Database Systems
*SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, LAMP Stack*
